# ARC Dashboard

The ARC Dashboard is a set of workbooks composed of visual and charts installed on the customer subscription in the Workbooks area. The Dashboard exposes detailed information about the following: 

SQL resources  

ARC installation status details 

ARC Best Practice Assessment results 

 
## SQL Resources 

This part shows details about all the SQL instances, including versions, editions, and the number of databases for each instance. Moreover, for each SQL instance it shows the build number, collation, and the supports (Standard and Extended) expiration dates.  

#ARC Installation 

This part shows the list of ARC machines with SQL Server installed, together with information about the correct installation and configuration of ARC SQL Server extension. With this section is it possible to verify that ARC nodes are connected to Azure, ARC agents are up and running and the environment is correctly configured to operate efficiently. 

 

#BPA 

This part allows the navigation of ARC Best Practice Assessment at infrastructure level. Through intuitive visualization, it is possible to navigate all data coming from the Assessment, identify the most critical issues and localize corresponding instances or databases affected, with an extremely quick navigation experience. With a few clicks it is possible to start with the infrastructure vision and go in detail to analyze the details of a single specific issue, getting information about the problem and best practice information as well.  

 

#Goal 

For this area, the ARC Dashboard serves as a strategic tool for driving continuous improvement and alignment with industry SQL Server best practices. The Dashboard empowers stakeholders to drill down deeper into the assessment findings, enabling informed decision-making and prioritization of the most critical issues at infra level, and the corresponding remediation efforts.  

Far more than a mere collection of findings, this delivery serves as a roadmap to secure and optimize your SQL Server infrastructure. From performance fine-tuning to security fortification, each remediation step is designed to empower your team with actionable strategies for immediate implementation. Recommendations are crafted to elevate your database environment's performance, security, and reliability and keep it compliant and efficient. 

 

#Copilot component 

The delivery includes a Copilot component which is used to increase our ability to identify issues and define the remediation steps starting from best practice documentation.  

Copilot has been trained with ARC BP data and official SQL Best Practice documentation links containing the Microsoft technical information on all specific issues. This component analyzes the issues from Best Practice Assessment and compiles a technical  document listing the remediation steps to be implemented to remediate each selected issue.  

 

#Goal 

Copilot component introduces the advantage of streamlining and enhancing the content creation process through its advanced AI capabilities.  

It leverages a vast repository of technical patterns and best practices, ensuring that the document's content is accurate and up-to-date. It helps in avoiding common pitfalls and ensures that the best practice steps are comprehensive and relevant.  

Overall, Copilot greatly accelerates the document creation process by offering real-time suggestions and code examples based on the context of the official Microsoft documentation. This saves significant time that would otherwise be spent on manual research and writing.
